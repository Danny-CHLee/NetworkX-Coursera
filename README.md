## Applied Social Network Analysis in Python
This is a record on the course Applied Social Network Analysis in Python that I took on Coursera.  
The course is taught by Prof. Daniel Romero from the University of Michigan.  
There are 4 assignments on using NetworkX to analyse social network data.  

The first assignment is about creating and manipulating Graphs.  
The second assignment is about analysing network connectivity.  
The third assignment is about analysing centrality measures.  
The forth assignment is about small world and preferential attachment models.
